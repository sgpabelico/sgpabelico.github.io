	<h1> My Portfolio Inspiration</h1>
	<p> The portfolio that I took the most inspiration from came from <a href="https://harrisonjansma.com/">Harrison Jansma</a>. He is a data analyst and I thought his portfolio was really sleek, easy to navigate and overall just gave off a very professional look. I thought his home page was really simple, and I liked how clean it looks. I also really liked the placement of the nav bar. Originally mine was centered but I think moving it to the right edge might be more functional and I like the way it looks.</p>
	<p> Another portfolio that I really enjoyed looking at was <a href="https://www.glorialo.design/">Gloria Lo's</a>. The interaction of her website was really engaging and I liked how something as simple as highlighting the word you are on can make a big difference. I thought her drop down menu in her nav bar was easy to use and her recent work page was really clear and it didn't look cluttered. It made me feel like I wanted to click it because it would be fun and it wasn't just a hyperlink.</p>
