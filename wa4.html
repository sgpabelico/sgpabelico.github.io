	<h1 id='grad'> Why Community is A Criminally Underrated Show and Will Remain That Way. </h1>

	<p>Community is by far and away one of my favorite TV shows of all time. However, when I tell people about the show the vast majority have never heard of it before. It is one of the surviving TV shows on Netflix having outlasted shows like The Office and Friends. Even though it remains accessible to the general population on the most popular streaming platform it still doesn’t get the recognition it deserves. I believe this is because the show doesn’t have a strong central romance line. When looking at some other comparable shows that aired at the same time, it becomes more obvious that this is indeed the case.</p>

	<p>Put simply, America loves love. If we take a critical look at what shows or movies become really popular something they almost always have in common is a strong central couple. For example, Friends had Monica/Chandler and Ross and Rachel. The Office had Jim and Pam. The entire Bachelor franchise is based on the assumption that America wants to watch people fall in love. So does it then remain that if a show does not have a strong love story, it is disadvantaged when it comes to garnering attention? I would argue that it does. Having any bit of romance that fans can root for and “ship” is important when looking at fan retention. This <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2017/03/amatonormativity-everybody-should-be-coupled-up.html"> article</a> from The Cut goes into detail about why Americans seem to be so obsessed with romance. The article talks about how by putting characters in a relationship, the character becomes more "normal" and sort of unattainable. Since not everybody is in a relationship and because America idealizes being in a relationship, by putting main characters in them they become "better". The article talks about how having characters fall in love is the easiest option when it comes to developing relationships. Even though not every friendship people have ends with being married, for progression sake it is easier to write a main character a love interest then to develop just a "best friend". Plus, viewers might find that unsatisfying or anticlimactic. </p>

	<p>This visualization was created from a dataset from Kaggle that lists information about all episodes of  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/imbenab/community-episodes-imdb-ratings">Community.</a> By looking at the IMDB ratings we can get a better understanding of which episodes landed well with the general public and which ones weren’t well received. I’m hoping we will be able to see some trends in the type of episode that gets ranked highly.</p>

	<h2 class='blue'> Average IMDB Rating</h2>
	<img src="Screen Shot 2021-02-19 at 1.11.20 PM.png"alt='mean'>

	<p>The average episode rating for this entire series was about an 8. This shows me that the Community fanbase was relatively loyal and they enjoyed the series as a whole. Since the fanbase of this show was relatively small, they were very outspoken in their support of the series. This is apparent when looking at the Community <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/community/">Reddit Page</a>. The show stopped airing in 2015 yet almost 6 years later the reddit is still very active.</p>


	<h2 class='blue'> Top 10 Highest Rated Episodes on IMDB</h2>
	<img src="Screen Shot 2021-02-19 at 1.10.50 PM.png"alt='chart'>

	<p>When looking at the top 10 highest rated episodes of community it becomes clearer that romance does wonders to boost ratings. The chart above shows the episode titles and ratings of the 10 highest rated episodes. The number 1 episode is “Remedial Chaos Theory”. While it is hard to take the credit away from this episode from simply being the best thing to ever air on television, this is also one of the 2 episodes where two of the main characters share a kiss. It is between the most prominent “could-they, might-they” couple that this show has produced, Annie and Jeff. In addition to this, this episode also marks the beginning of one of the only “couples” that becomes official on the show, Britta and Troy. The second highest rated episode is “Modern Warfare” which is once again one of the only episodes in the entire series where anything romantic happens between two of the main characters. My theory is because the Community fandom was so starved for any semblance of romance that whenever it rarely occurred, they absolutely loved it.</p>

	<p>Now you might be thinking, maybe the show is not well known because it didn’t have any prominent actors. However, to this I have the panacea. Childish Gambino. Yes, THE Donald Glover plays Troy Barnes for 5 seasons of Community. If you don't know who that is...check out this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/12/the-rise-of-donald-glover-childish-gambino"> link</a>. If this alone weren’t enough to convince you, Allison Brie, Chevy Chase, Joel McHale, Ken Jeong all played starring roles in this cast. The cast is star-studded. The show definitely had enough noteworthy names to garner any sort of attention. However, it remains relatively unknown. This show had excellent writers, excellent actors, excellent plot lines and yet any notability remained elusive. The best argument for why this happened is because it did not have the stability of a central couple.</p>

	<h3>Community will be the hill I die on for the rest of my life. I will spread the good word about this show until everyone I know has seen it. It took me 21 years to watch it but once I did, the fact that it was so unknown felt inherently wrong. America needs a couple to root for. This is evident in so many popular shows. Additional examples include: How I Met Your Mother (Lily/Marshall), Gossip Girl (Blair/Chuck), One Tree Hill (Nathan/Haley) and the list goes on forever. One show that will never be included on that list for better or for worse is Community. If it had altered its story line to include a love story arc it wouldn’t have been the original show it was. However, because of this I don’t believe it will ever gain as much mainstream traction as some other arguably less entertaining shows. To conclude, go watch Community.</h3>
