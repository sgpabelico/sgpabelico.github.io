<h1 style="background-color:Tomato;"> Game Stop Stock Madness </h1>

<h2 style="background-color:Gray;"> This entire situation has made me want to understand stocks. I have never in my life found stocks to be interesting. Maybe that is changing...  </h2>

<p> This entire situation has restored my faith in the idea that there is power in people and numbers. Social media platforms have always been a cause for concern for big governments or corporations seeking to consolidate power. If they can get people isolated and in the dark, there is almost nothing the majority of people can do about it. They are subject to the whims of the “powers that be” on wall street. One question I believe would be interesting to explore is: what responsibility do social media platforms have to protecting their users from making potential harmful actions? Additionally, from a pure INFO scientist perspective how could this have come to fruition and is it likely to continue happening? All in all, I am glad we were assigned to look into this because it is absolutely fascinating.<br>The first question I want to explore is what responsibility do social media platforms have to protect or prevent against collective action? In this case where the worst thing that could happen is a bunch of millionaires would lose money, it is easy to negate the implications of social media platforms like reddit. However, this got me thinking about a slightly similar scandal that involved WhatsApp and the formation of terrorist groups. At what point are owners supposed to step in and moderate or even censor what is being allowed on their platforms? This in tandem with the battle over Twitter’s censorship of former president Trump is something that is going to divide even more party lines. In my opinion, it wouldn’t be fair to draw one bold black line that decides if something gets to stay or not. Things nowadays are rarely that simple. It will be important for companies to consider the ramifications of what their users are doing and what aspects of their platform are allowing them to take these actions. I don’t know that companies should be limiting what is allowed to be said online but I understand the argument that when words implicate action, it can be dangerous. It is interesting to hear how this was covered in the media on both sides. The reactions were a bit hypocritical in my opinion, but what else is new?<br>Another really interesting thing to consider out of this Game Stop scandal is under what conditions was this able to happen? Looking at past examples of collective action problems on social media it seems that the ability to collaborate freely and openly is the perfect breeding ground for something like this to be organized. Additionally, one thing that will never be able to be censored is diversity of backgrounds and education. This group effort shows that no matter how lofty a goal, people will find a way. The fact that every day citizens were able to best massive hedge funds is terrifying and sort of exciting at the same time. From a data perspective, it would be really interesting to look into the genesis of the entire ordeal. What was the rhetoric on the subreddits and if compared to similar events in the past, were the beginnings similar? People will find a way to community, I think that is human nature. So I’m not sure we can place a lot of blame on companies like Reddit or WhatsApp for things like this forming on their platform.<br>Overall, I think this opened a lot of people’s eyes to “dumb money” and it forced Wall Street to give more credit to individual people. The responsibility of actions like these events whether positive or negative should fall solely on the people in them. I think placing blame on the platforms is misguided. This entire situation showed big corporations that people still have power and they can’t be written off because of a seeming lack of knowledge. </p>
